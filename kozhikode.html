Known for having one of the most beautiful backwaters of Kerala, this town is a charming place, and for reasons too many. It is believed that Vasco-da-Gama set his foot first in India here and this was when the Spice Route was established. Calicut or much famed as Kozhikode, is one such beautiful city in Kerala that feel like every traveler’s dream. A pristine haven in nature, Kozhikode is filled with lush greenery, tranquil beaches, and historical forts.

                                    </p> 
                                    <p>Calicut, now known as Kozhikode, is a historically important city of Kerala. From being an important part of India’s trade throughout history, Calicut has also seen its control change between rules, and then ultimately shifted to the British East India Company in 1792, when it was rebuilt.

                                    </p>
                                    <p>Also famous for spice and coconut export, the history of the town lends it a lot of tourism friendly charm. Kozhikode is also blessed with abundant natural beauty in the form of ocean vistas, waterfalls, and of course, a network of the beautiful backwaters.
