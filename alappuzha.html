                                    <p class="mb-5">Washed by the silvery waves of the Arabian Sea, Alappuzha welcomes you to the backwaters of kerala. The Palm fringed canals and shores bustling with glimpses from the day to day life in the country side, the mirror still lagoons, picture book lakesides and its long sandy beach has blessed , the water locked district, to become one of the best Backwater tourism destinations in God's Own Country.

                                    </p>                        
                                    <p class="mb-5">The large network of canals provides Alappuzha its lifeline. Water carnivals using the gigantic snake boats and the country canoes of varying sizes have an important role in the community life of the people of the district.

                                    </p>
                                    <p class="mb-5">Another delightful experience while in Alappuzha is the houseboat cruise. The houseboats you find in the backwaters of Alappuzha are in fact a reworked version of the Kettuvallams of olden times. Kettuvallam is a Malayalam word, ‘Kettu’, refers to dwelling structures and ‘Vallom’ means boat. In the olden days, kettuvallam or boat with thatched roof that covers over wooden hulls was used to carry tons of rice and spices.
